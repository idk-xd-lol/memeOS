<h1>Hi, it's my own experimental OS on Python</h1>
<p>This OS will be using mostly python for core and os, but also there will some c++ code for app isolation and booting and it will use grub as bootloader</p>
<p>IMPORTANT THING: It's not real OS and it won't replace Linux, Windows or MacOS, it's just an experemental OS, so don't take it very serious</p>
<p>i'm not professional programmer, so i will make this project very long, and also there might be long breaks, because i'll learning something new</p>
<p>sorry for bad english</p>
